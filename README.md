# matmul-avx
Course project for [UCSD CSE 260 - Winter 2019](https://sites.google.com/eng.ucsd.edu/cse260-winter-2019/assignments/assignment-1) in collaboration with [@Jun0413](https://github.com/Jun0413).

This implements matrix multiplication with AVX instruction and cache blocking.

Below is the performance of this code. On the same machine, OpenBLAS achieves roughly 30Gflop/s.
